Hello, my name is Henry Liang. 

I am a Data Scientist in the NLP space. I'm particularly interested in agentic LLMs.  I hold an M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science/) and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). 

In my previous roles and projects, I worked extensively in the data science field, overseeing projects from conception to completion. I've developed and optimized RAG frameworks, implemented robust feedback loops for RAG frameworks, and created systems for knowledge graph analysis with LLMs.

Feel free to checkout my [github](https://github.com/HenryLiang-123) where I document my projects.
