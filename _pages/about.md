I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the NLP (natural language processing) and TTS (text to speech) space. I hold an M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science/) and dual B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). 

In my previous roles and projects, I've worked extensively in the data science field, overseeing projects from conception to completion. I've developed systems for knowledge graph analysis with LLMs, diagnostic frameworks to enhance game impression forecasting, and real-time inference systems for demand forecasting.

Aside from working in the NLP and TTS space, I am also actively working on related personal projects. These projects most center around developing tools and technologies that solve inconveniences in my day to day life, but mostly, they're for my own enjoyment.

Feel free to checkout my [github](https://github.com/HenryLiang-123) where I document my projects.
