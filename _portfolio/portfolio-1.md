title: "Can LLM's Understand Knowledge Graphs?"
excerpt: "A system of LLMs tasked with understanding differences between snapshots of graphs, with usecases in detecting network hijacking incidents and routing anomalies.<br/><img src='/images/llmsys.png'>"

The objective of the project was:

1. Develop efficient prompting to identify differences in two graphs.

2. Apply different prompting techniques such as zero shot learning, few shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

3. Understand the current bounds to LLMâ€™s understanding of Graphs.

4. Test final prompting technique on desired dataset.

The final architecture of the system we built to achieve the goal:
