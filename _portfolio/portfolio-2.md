As part of a year-long practicum project, my team and I built a pipeline for real-time inference for streaming data and deployed it on AWS. The pipeline was adapted to 3 difference usecases: Divvy Bike demand forecast, hard drive failure prediction, and motion prediction based on sensor readings.

If you'd like to see the implementation, check out the github [repo](https://github.com/HenryLiang-123/CDL-UseCases)
